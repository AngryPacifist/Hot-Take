Hot Take: Social Prediction Feeds on Base & Farcaster

Concept:
Hot Take is a TikTok-style, social-in-social Mini App where every scroll surfaces a short prediction or hot take you can stake on. Users engage not by just liking or commenting, but by putting skin in the game—staking USDC, points, or other tokens. Every stance is public, making each bet a part of your onchain identity and reputation.

Vision

Hot Take is not just a prediction market. It’s a social layer where:

Bets = posts

Correct calls = reputation

Communities form around niches

Culture drives attention, not just profit


In essence, Hot Take is TikTok for conviction: short, addictive, social, and onchain.
